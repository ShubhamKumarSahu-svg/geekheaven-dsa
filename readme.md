### Short Introduction

Hello! I'm Shubham Kumar Sahu, currently pursuing my studies with enrollment number IIT2024209. My web development journey began in my first semester, driven by curiosity about how websites work, and it has grown into a strong passion for building interactive, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

I strengthened my foundation through Colt Steele’s Web Developer Bootcamp and later advanced with Jonas Schmedtmann’s React.js and Node.js Mastery courses. Along the way, I’ve built projects like Bro-Chat and many others, where I applied real-world concepts of frontend and backend development.

Currently, I’m exploring Next.js to take my full-stack skills to the next level, while also expanding into Generative AI. I’ve learned to design and build Agentic AI applications, blending AI with modern web technologies.

I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with new tools, and constantly pushing myself to improve. This project is just one step in my journey—I’m committed to taking web development and AI to a much greater extent in the future.
